# geraspec

This is a simple ipython notebook to extract information from Gaussian log to plot a Infrared and a Raman spectrum.  It is like Gaussview but you can get a finished figure with plotted peaks.  You can scale the spectra, choose gaussian or lorentzian shape and the  full width at half maximum (FWHM).
